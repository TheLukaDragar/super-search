To find the difference in the number of votes, we need to calculate the total number of votes cast. Although the total vote count is not directly provided, we can infer it from the information given about the voter turnout.\n\n**Voter Turnout and Total Votes:**\nAccording to source [15], the voter turnout in the presidential election was 86.82%, and participation in the parliamentary vote was 87%. However, the total number of eligible voters is not provided in the sources. For the purpose of this calculation, let's assume we're working with the percentage of votes received by each candidate, as the actual numbers would scale accordingly.\n\n**Calculating the Difference in Votes (assuming a scalable percentage-based calculation):**\n- **Erdo\u011fan's Votes:** 53% of total votes\n- **\u0130nce's Votes:** 31% of total votes\n- **Difference in Percentage Points:** 53% - 31% = 22% more of the total votes for Erdo\u011fan compared to \u0130nce\n\n**To express this in a more concrete manner without the total vote count:**\n- If we were to hypothetically consider every 1% of the vote as representing X number of voters, Erdo\u011fan would have 22X more votes than \u0130nce.\n\n**Concrete Numbers (if total votes were known):**\n- Unfortunately, without the explicit total number of votes cast (which isn't provided in the sources), we cannot calculate an exact numerical difference (e.g., \"X thousand more votes\"). The difference is 22 percentage points, which directly translates to the proportion of the total votes but requires the total vote count to be expressed in absolute numbers.\n\n**Sources Cited for Key Information:**\n- Voter turnout and percentages: [15]\n- Election results (percentages for Erdo\u011fan and \u0130nce): [4]","enhanced_queries":["Turkey 2018 presidential election results: Muharrem \u0130nce vs winning candidate vote difference","site:tr.wikipedia.org \"2018 Turkish presidential election\" \"Muharrem \u0130nce\" \"vote margin\"","\"June 24, 2018 Turkish election\" \"winner vote count\" -\"Muharrem \u0130nce vote count\" (winner - \u0130nce) inurl:news inurl:2018"],"metadata":{"topic":"Politics","answer_type":"Number","urls":["https:\/\/ysk.gov.tr\/doc\/dosyalar\/Ingilizce\/ElectionResults\/2018CB-416D_en.pdf","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2018_Muharrem_%C4%B0nce_presidential_campaign"]},"retrieved_urls":["https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/873950\/turkish-presidential-election-results\/","https:\/\/www.setav.org\/en\/assets\/uploads\/2018\/08\/R117.pdf","https:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/news\/2018\/6\/25\/turkey-elections-2018-all-the-latest-updates","https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-europe-44596072","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2018_Turkish_general_election"],"search_results":{},"success":true,"error":null,"final_grade":"C"}

However, based on the information available, we can deduce some relevant details:\n\n* According to source [1], Jean Sterne reported the use of Metformin to treat diabetes in 1957.\n* Source [2] mentions that in 1956, Sterne critically assessed the evidence around flumamine and recalled his involvement in a disappointing study of galegine, leading to his interest in Metformin. It also states that Sterne worked at Aron Laboratories in Suresnes, west of Paris, France.\n* Source [3] indicates that Metformin was introduced for the treatment of adult-onset diabetes in 1957, but it does not specify the country.\n* Source [7] provides a Metformin timeline, stating that Metformin was introduced as a diabetes medication in the UK in 1958, but it does not mention the introduction year in France.\n\n**Conclusion:** While the exact year of Metformin's introduction in France is not provided in the sources, it is clear that Jean Sterne's work in France in the mid-1950s was pivotal in Metformin's development as a diabetes treatment, with reports of its use in 1957.

The scheduled \"first flight\" mentioned in Source [3] occurred on February 2, 1974, which is consistently reported across sources as a separate, planned event.","enhanced_queries":["General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon first unplanned flight date","F-16 Fighting Falcon maiden flight details \"day month year\" -planned","site:wikipedia.org OR site:military.com OR site:airforce.gov \"F-16 Fighting Falcon\" \"first flight\" \"unplanned\" \"date\""],"metadata":{"topic":"Science and technology","answer_type":"Date","urls":["https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/General_Dynamics_F-16_Fighting_Falcon","https:\/\/www.aerotime.aero\/articles\/50-years-ago-the-f-16-fighting-falcon-took-off-for-the-first-time#:~:text=The%20first%20flight%20of%20the%20iconic%20F%2D16%20Fighting%20Falcon%2C%20initially%20scheduled%20for%20February%202%2C%201974%2C%20took%20an%20unexpected%20turn%20on%20January%2020%2C%201974%2C%20at%20Edwards%20Air%20Force%20Base%20in%20California.","https:\/\/www.popularmechanics.com\/military\/aviation\/a30645599\/f-16-first-flight\/#:~:text=On%20January%2020%2C%201974%2C%20test%20pilot%20Phil%20Oestricher%20was%20taking%20the%20YF%2D16%20prototype%20down%20the%20runway%20at%20Edwards%20Air%20Force%20Base%20when%20things%20went%2C%20well%2C%20not%20according%20to%20plan","https:\/\/simple.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/General_Dynamics_F16_Fighting_Falcon#:~:text=First%20flight,ago%20(unplanned)"]},"retrieved_urls":["https:\/\/www.popularmechanics.com\/military\/aviation\/a30645599\/f-16-first-flight\/","https:\/\/www.aerotime.aero\/articles\/50-years-ago-the-f-16-fighting-falcon-took-off-for-the-first-time","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/General_Dynamics_F-16_Fighting_Falcon","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/General_Dynamics_F-16_Fighting_Falcon_variants","https:\/\/www.airdatanews.com\/50-years-since-the-unexpected-first-flight-of-the-f-16-fighter\/"],"search_results":{},"success":true,"error":null,"final_grade":"A"}

{"case_id":"679bd30f-b424-4ee6-8e7e-48cedd42e1d6","question":"Who is the god with the Hawaiian name Kama\u02bbehuakanaloa?","true_answer":"Kanaloa","pipeline_answer":"**Query Answer:**\nThe god with the Hawaiian name Kama\u02bbehuakanaloa is not directly mentioned in the provided sources. However, based on the information given, it appears that Kama\u02bbehuakanaloa might be an alternative name or epithet for a Hawaiian deity. \n\n**Most Likely Association:**\nGiven the context and the names provided in the sources, the most likely association for Kama\u02bbehuakanaloa is with **Kanaloa**. Here\u2019s why:\n\n1. **Name Similarity:** While \"Kama\u02bbehuakanaloa\" is not explicitly mentioned, its similarity in structure and the inclusion of \"Kanaloa\" within the name suggests a strong connection to the god Kanaloa.\n   \n2. **Lack of Direct Reference to Kama\u02bbehuakanaloa:** None of the sources directly mention \"Kama\u02bbehuakanaloa,\" which implies it might not be a commonly used name in available literature or it could be a less known epithet.\n\n3. **Kanaloa's Known Names and Epithets:** Source [15] lists various names and epithets for Kanaloa, including Tangaroa, Lono-kanaloa, Kane-hekili, and Mo\u2018o-kanaloa. This shows Kanaloa is known by multiple names, making it plausible that Kama\u02bbehuakanaloa could be another, less documented epithet.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile the sources do not explicitly mention \"Kama\u02bbehuakanaloa,\" the name's similarity to Kanaloa and the practice of Hawaiian gods having multiple epithets suggest that Kama\u02bbehuakanaloa is likely associated with **Kanaloa**, the Hawaiian god of the ocean, underworld, and a powerful healer. However, without a direct reference, this association remains speculative based on the provided context.\n\n**Source Citations for Kanaloa's Context:**\n[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]","enhanced_queries":["Kama\u02bbehuakanaloa god mythology","Hawaiian deity \"Kama\u02bbehuakanaloa\" origin story","site:wikipedia.org OR site:.gov \"Kama\u02bbehuakanaloa\" Hawaiian god OR deity"],"metadata":{"topic":"Other","answer_type":"Other","urls":["https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kama%CA%BBehuakanaloa_Seamount","https:\/\/www.patheos.com\/blogs\/danpeterson\/2024\/02\/103967.html","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kama%CA%BBehuakanaloa_Seamount","https:\/\/kawaiola.news\/moomeheu\/a-change-of-name\/"]},"retrieved_urls":["https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kama%CA%BBehuakanaloa_Seamount","https:\/\/oldworldgods.com\/hawaiian\/kanaloa-god\/","https:\/\/www.samperalta.org\/post\/unveiling-kanaloa-exploring-the-symbolism-and-energy-of-the-hawaiian-god","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kanaloa","https:\/\/mythlok.com\/kanaloa\/"],"search_results":{},"success":true,"error":null,"final_grade":"A"}

[1, 5]\n\n**Explanation:**\nWhile the query specifically asks for a \"peninsular plateau,\" the provided sources more commonly refer to the larger \"Peninsular Plateau of India\" as a whole or its subdivisions like the Deccan Plateau. However, when focusing on the criteria of extending 900 km with peaks above 1,000 m, the Satpura Range matches this description. \n\n- **Source [1]** mentions the Satpura Range extends \"some 900 kilometres (560 miles) across central India\" with \"many of its peaks rise above 1000 metres (3300 feet),\" directly fulfilling the query's criteria.\n- **Source [5]** also describes the Satpura Range, mentioning it stretches for \"around 900 km\" and highlights a peak, Dhupgarh, at 1350 m, further supporting the range's qualification.\n\n**Note on Potential Confusion:**\n- The term \"peninsular plateau\" in the query might cause confusion, as the primary sources discuss the Peninsular Plateau of India as a broad geographical feature. However, based on the specific details provided (900 km long with peaks above 1,000 m), the Satpura Range is identified as the matching geographical entity.\n- The Deccan Plateau, a part of the larger Peninsular Plateau, does not specifically match the 900 km criterion with peaks above 1,000 m in the provided sources, though it's a significant plateau within the peninsular region.","enhanced_queries":["Which peninsular plateau of India extends 900 km, with many peaks rising above 1,000 m?"],"metadata":{"topic":"Geography","answer_type":"Place","urls":["https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Geography_of_India","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Geography_of_India","http:\/\/indiansaga.com\/others\/index1.html","https:\/\/dlab.epfl.ch\/wikispeedia\/wpcd\/wp\/g\/Geography_of_India.htm"]},"retrieved_urls":["https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Geography_of_India","https:\/\/www.nextias.com\/blog\/peninsular-plateau\/","https:\/\/www.pmfias.com\/peninsular-plateau-deccan-plateau-marwar-plateau-bundelkhand-plateau-malwa-plateau-baghelkhand-chotanagpur-plateau\/","https:\/\/www.q-files.com\/geography\/geography-of-india\/peninsular-plateau","https:\/\/moirabaricollegeonline.co.in\/attendence\/classnotes\/files\/1608044317.pdf"],"search_results":{},"success":true,"error":null,"final_grade":"A"}

The sources appear to be a collection of patent applications for various exercise machines and related inventions, but none of them directly mention \"Edward A.

Are primarily focused on exercise equipment and related inventions, without providing a comprehensive database of all patents or inventions from the 19th century.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nTo find the accurate answer, it is recommended to search through historical patent archives or databases that cover the late 19th century, such as:\n\n* The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) historical patent database.\n* The Library of Congress's patent collections.\n* Other historical archives that might hold patent information from the 1880s.\n\n**Example of a Potential Follow-up Query:**\nIf you have access to historical patent databases, you could query using the following details:\n\n* Name: Edward A.

Excavations here have yielded numerous artifacts, including ceremonial vessels, pot stands, jewelry, and ornamental regalia [7].\n\n2. **Igbo Richard**: Identified as a burial chamber [6, 7], this site contains evidence of an elite burial, with findings including over 100,000 glass beads, preserved textiles, elephant tusks, and cast bronze regalia accompanying human remains [7]. It is associated with a single set of human skeletal remains, possibly belonging to a priest-king [1].\n\n3. **Igbo Jonah**: Described as a cache [2] or possibly a disposal pit [7], this site has produced a significant example of ritual pottery, charcoal, animal bones, and some bronze sculptures [1].

However, we can attempt to find a relevant piece of information that might help in deducing or approximating the answer.\n\nAfter carefully reviewing all the sources, the most relevant information related to the heat capacity of elements is found in source [3] (https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Heat_capacities_of_the_elements_(data_page)), which discusses the heat capacities of elements. However, the specific heat capacity of selenium at 25\u00b0C is mentioned in this source, but it does not provide the molar heat capacity at STP (which is defined at 0\u00b0C and 1 atm) in joules per kelvin per mole (J\/(K\u00b7mol)).\n\nSource [3] mentions that all values refer to 25 \u00b0C and to the thermodynamically stable standard state at that temperature unless noted.

However, we can make an approximation based on the information available.\n\n**Source Analysis:**\n- **Source [1]** mentions the barrel length as \"4.9 inches long.\" To convert inches to meters, we use the conversion factor: 1 inch = 0.0254 meters.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Barrel length in inches: 4.9 inches\n- Conversion to meters: 4.9 inches * 0.0254 meters\/inch = approximately 0.1246 meters\n\n**Important Note:** The calculated barrel length in meters (approximately 0.1246 meters) seems unusually short for a howitzer, suggesting a potential misunderstanding in the conversion process or an error in the source's measurement unit. Typically, artillery pieces like the Mod 56 have barrel lengths measured in calibers, with the Mod 56 being a 105mm piece. A common barrel length for such artillery is around 22-33 calibers, which for a 105mm gun would translate to approximately 2.31 to 3.46 meters (22*105mm to 33*105mm). Since the provided sources do not explicitly state the barrel length in meters or calibers that can be reliably converted, and given the significant discrepancy with expected norms, the calculation from Source [1] might not accurately represent the barrel length of the OTO-Melara Mod 56 pack howitzer.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nFor accurate technical specifications, including the barrel length of the OTO-Melara Mod 56 pack howitzer, consulting official OTO-Melara documentation, military technical manuals, or reputable defense publications is advisable.\n\n**Citation for Attempted Answer:**\n[1] https:\/\/www.militaryfactory.com\/armor\/detail.php?armor_id=1026 (Note: The relevance of this source to the question is high, but the provided measurement appears to be incorrect or not applicable for the conversion as expected.)","enhanced_queries":["OTO-Melara Mod 56 pack howitzer barrel length in meters","Technical specifications OTO-Melara Mod 56 howitzer barrel length meters","site:wikipedia.org OR site:military.wikia.com "],"metadata":{"topic":"Science and technology","answer_type":"Number","urls":["https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/OTO_Melara_Mod_56","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/OTO_Melara_Mod_56","https:\/\/weaponsystems.net\/system\/726-105mm+Model+56","https:\/\/www.forecastinternational.com\/archive\/disp_pdf.cfm?DACH_RECNO=376"]},"retrieved_urls":["https:\/\/www.militaryfactory.com\/armor\/detail.php?armor_id=1026","https:\/\/weaponsystems.net\/system\/726-105mm+Model+56","https:\/\/www.forecastinternational.com\/archive\/disp_pdf.cfm?DACH_RECNO=376","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/M-56_Howitzer","https:\/\/old.weaponsystems.net\/weaponsystem\/DD03%20-%20Model%2056.html"],"search_results":{},"success":true,"error":null,"final_grade":"C"}

However, there are hints at historical contexts and entities involved in the slave trade with Cuba:\n\n* **Asiento de Negros**: This was a contract or license granted by the Spanish government to other countries or companies to supply a certain number of enslaved Africans to the Spanish colonies, including Cuba. The holders of the Asiento varied over time, including Portuguese, Dutch, and British merchants [19].\n* **Specific Merchant or Company for Cuba**: While the sources do not pinpoint a single foreign merchant or company issued the right specifically for Cuba at a particular time, they mention the involvement of various entities in the slave trade. For instance, the Dutch West India Company began outsourcing the slave trade from the 1730s [2], and a Havana company paid Spain for the Asiento to import slaves to Cuba in 1740 [2]. Additionally, there are mentions of \"Cuesta Manzanal & Hermano\" in the context of the slave trade and Cuba [1, 6, 11], but without explicit connection to being granted the Asiento for Cuba.\n* **Regulations on Trade with Cuba**: The sources suggest the existence of regulations and instructions for trade, including the slave trade, with Cuba. For example, \"Instrucci\u00f3n dada al Capit\u00e1n y oficiales de la fragata nombrada la Junta Central\" for acquiring slaves in Angola and Calabar [16, 17], but these do not directly link to a foreign merchant being ordered to regulate trade with Cuba.\n\n**Most Relevant Sources Cited:**\n- [2] for the Asiento's context and its holders over time.\n- [1, 6, 11] for mentions of \"Cuesta Manzanal & Hermano\" in relation to the slave trade and Cuba, though not explicitly as holders of the Asiento for Cuba.\n- [16, 17] for examples of instructions related to the slave trade involving Cuba, without specifying a foreign merchant's regulatory role.\n\n**Uncertainty:** \nThe provided sources do not directly answer the question with a specific foreign merchant's name who was both issued the right to transact slaves on Spain's behalf and ordered to regulate trade with Cuba. The historical context of the Asiento de Negros and various entities involved in the slave trade with Cuba are discussed, but a precise match to the question's criteria is not found within the given information.","enhanced_queries":["foreign merchant granted Spanish slave trade monopoly Cuba","historical figure authorized by Spain for Cuban slave trade regulations","site:academic.journals \"Spanish Crown appointed merchant\" Cuba slave trade regulations history"],"metadata":{"topic":"History","answer_type":"Other","urls":["https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/History_of_Cuba","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/History_of_Cuba","https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/topic\/asiento-de-negros","https:\/\/curiosity.lib.harvard.edu\/south-sea-bubble\/feature\/the-south-sea-company-and-the-slave-trade"]},"retrieved_urls":["https:\/\/clacs.berkeley.edu\/cuba-slavery-and-siege-havana","https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/org\/science\/article\/pii\/S1382237317000903","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Asiento_de_Negros","https:\/\/digital.csic.es\/bitstream\/10261\/259058\/1\/A%20Caribbean%20Affair.pdf","https:\/\/brill.com\/view\/journals\/nwig\/91\/1-2\/article-p1_1.xml?srsltid=AfmBOopOThSYdeQy1poud3JWU198M27tlCn2l58Sf16TR8Oip1Rwlk8N"],"search_results":{},"success":true,"error":null,"final_grade":"C"}

Blow my brains out?","pipeline_answer":"**Terry Kath's Famously Ironic Last Words**\n\nTerry Kath, the guitarist and vocalist of the band Chicago, tragically passed away on January 23, 1978, in an accidental shooting. According to multiple sources, including bandmates and witnesses, his last words were indeed famously ironic.\n\n**Confirmed Last Words:**\n\"What do you think I'm gonna do? Blow my brains out?\" [1, 2, 5, 6, 7]\n\nThese words were spoken as he put a supposedly unloaded semi-automatic 9-mm pistol to his temple and pulled the trigger, unaware that there was still a round in the chamber.\n\n**Contrasting Source:**\nOne source, however, reports different last words: \"Don't worry it's not loaded\" [4]. This discrepancy highlights the potential for variations in reported last words, but the majority of sources confirm the more widely-known ironic phrase.\n\n**Context and Caution:**\nTerry Kath's death serves as a stark reminder of the importance of firearm safety. Several sources emphasize the crucial rules for handling guns, stressing that every firearm should be treated as if it were loaded [3, 5, 12]. This tragic incident underscores the devastating consequences of neglecting these safety protocols.\n\n**References:**\n[1] https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/todayilearned\/comments\/1j6o6qm\/til_that_the_last_words_of_terry_kath_guitarist\/\n[2] https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/todayilearned\/comments\/mr3k5o\/til_the_last_words_of_terry_kath_guitarist_and\/\n[3] https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/todayilearned\/comments\/1j6o6qm\/til_that_the_last_words_of_terry_kath_guitarist\/ (comment section)\n[4] https:\/\/m.facebook.com\/thisdayinmusic\/photos\/23rd-jan-1978-terry-kath-guitarist-with-chicago-accidentally-shot-himself-dead-w\/10156349550170167\/\n[5] https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/todayilearned\/comments\/mr3k5o\/til_the_last_words_of_terry_kath_guitarist_and\/ (comment section)\n[6] https:\/\/aquariumdrunkard.com\/2016\/01\/30\/on-the-occasion-of-chicago-guitarist-terry-kaths-70th-birthday\/\n[7] https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_last_words","enhanced_queries":["Terry Kath last words ironic","\"Terry Kath final quote\" ironic death","site:wikipedia.org OR site:rollingstone.com Terry Kath last words before death (2025 OR latest update)"],"metadata":{"topic":"Music","answer_type":"Other","urls":["https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Terry_Kath","https:\/\/aquariumdrunkard.com\/2016\/01\/30\/on-the-occasion-of-chicago-guitarist-terry-kaths-70th-birthday\/#:~:text=Terry%20Kath%20shot%20himself%20in,Blow%20my%20brains%20out%3F","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Terry_Kath","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_last_words"]},"retrieved_urls":["https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/todayilearned\/comments\/1j6o6qm\/til_that_the_last_words_of_terry_kath_guitarist\/","https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/todayilearned\/comments\/mr3k5o\/til_the_last_words_of_terry_kath_guitarist_and\/","https:\/\/aquariumdrunkard.com\/2016\/01\/30\/on-the-occasion-of-chicago-guitarist-terry-kaths-70th-birthday\/","https:\/\/m.facebook.com\/thisdayinmusic\/photos\/23rd-jan-1978-terry-kath-guitarist-with-chicago-accidentally-shot-himself-dead-w\/10156349550170167\/","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_last_words"],"search_results":{},"success":true,"error":null,"final_grade":"A"}

You can search for \"indianexpress.com\" on a WHOIS lookup website (e.g., whois.net, whois.icann.org) to see if the registration date is publicly available.\n\n2. **Contact the Registry Directly:** Reach out to the registry responsible for the \".com\" top-level domain (currently, VeriSign) or the Indian registry (NIXI) if the domain is country-specific, and inquire about the registration date. They might provide the information or guide you on how to obtain it.\n\n3. **Domain Registrar:** If you can identify the domain registrar for \"indianexpress.com\" (this information might be available through a WHOIS lookup), you can contact them directly. They may be able to provide the registration date or direct you to where you can find this information.\n\n**Sources Used for This Response:**\nNone directly, as the required information was not found within the provided sources [1-20].

Unfortunately, the sources provided do not explicitly mention a \"third Phantom Lady\" by that title, but rather, they discuss various iterations and reboots of the Phantom Lady character across different comic book series and publishers.\n\n**Identifying the Third Phantom Lady:**\n\n1. **Sandra Knight (Quality Comics, Fox Feature Syndicate, and Ajax-Farrell)**: The original and most well-documented Phantom Lady, with her story evolving across different publishers [1, 4, 12, 17, 19].\n2. **Dee Tyler (DC Comics)**: Introduced later, with less information provided in the sources regarding her being explicitly termed as the \"second\" Phantom Lady [9, 14].\n3. **Implication of a Successor**: Given the pattern and the mention of different characters taking on the mantle, it's plausible that a third iteration exists, especially considering the comic book tradition of character reboots and legacy characters.\n\n**The Third Phantom Lady's Secret Identity:**\n\nGiven the provided sources, there is **no explicit mention** of a character clearly identified as the \"third Phantom Lady\" along with her secret identity. The closest to a third iteration might be inferred from the context of character succession and comic book series reboots, but without a direct reference, pinpointing the secret identity of a specifically labeled \"third Phantom Lady\" is not feasible based on the information provided.\n\n**Sources Cited for Context:**\n\n- [1, 4, 12, 17, 19] for Sandra Knight (Original Phantom Lady)\n- [9, 14] for Dee Tyler (Impplied Second Phantom Lady, but not explicitly stated as such in the query's context)\n- The lack of explicit mention for a \"third Phantom Lady\" across all sources [1-20]\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nDue to the absence of explicit information regarding a \"third Phantom Lady\" in the provided sources, **it is not possible to accurately determine the secret identity** of such a character based on the given context.

[1]\n\n**Explanation:**\nWhile often confused with the term \"equinox,\" which refers to the moments when the Sun crosses the equator, resulting in approximately equal lengths of day and night everywhere on Earth [2, 4, 6], an equilux specifically denotes the day when the periods of daylight and nighttime are precisely equal, usually occurring a few days before the spring equinox and after the fall equinox in each respective hemisphere [1, 3, 5]. This distinction is crucial because, at the exact time of an equinox, the day is slightly longer than the night due to how sunrise and sunset are defined (the appearance and disappearance of the Sun's disk) and the Earth's atmospheric refraction, which bends sunlight [9, 13, 17].\n\n**Sources Cited:**\n[1] https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Equinox\n[2] https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Equinox\n[3] https:\/\/www.timeanddate.com\/astronomy\/equilux.html\n[4] https:\/\/www.merriam-webster.com\/word-of-the-day\/equinox-2015-09-23\n[5] https:\/\/www.timeanddate.com\/astronomy\/equilux.html\n[6] https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Equinox\n[9] https:\/\/www.timeanddate.com\/astronomy\/equilux.html\n[13] https:\/\/www.timeanddate.com\/astronomy\/equilux.html\n[17] https:\/\/www.timeanddate.com\/astronomy\/equilux.html","enhanced_queries":["21st century neologism for day-night equality","site:wikipedia.org \"exact day-night balance\" origin -before:2000","\"equinox neologism\" 2025 definition -exclude:traditional -exclude:historical"],"metadata":{"topic":"Science and technology","answer_type":"Other","urls":["https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Equinox","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Equinox","https:\/\/dictionary.cambridge.org\/us\/dictionary\/english\/equilux","https:\/\/www.metoffice.gov.uk\/weather\/learn-about\/weather\/seasons\/equinox-and-solstice"]},"retrieved_urls":["https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Equinox","https:\/\/www.timeanddate.com\/astronomy\/equilux.html","https:\/\/theconversation.com\/day-and-night-arent-equal-length-on-an-equinox-heres-why-157273","https:\/\/www.astropixels.com\/ephemeris\/soleq2001.html","https:\/\/www.merriam-webster.com\/word-of-the-day\/equinox-2015-09-23?pronunciation&lang=en_us&dir=e&file=equino03"],"search_results":{},"success":true,"error":null,"final_grade":"A"}

However, based on the context and Serra's known movements, we can make an educated inference.\n\n**Inference and Rationale:**\nGiven that Richard Serra moved to New York City in 1966, as stated in Source [1], and that his early works in New York, including \"To Lift\" from 1967, reflected his fascination with industrial materials (also mentioned in Source [1]), it is plausible to infer that \"To Lift\" was created in New York City. This inference is further supported by the fact that many of Serra's early experiments and exhibitions, as referenced in various sources (e.g., Sources [2], [4], and [12]), took place in New York, particularly after his move there.\n\n**Sources Cited for Context:**\n- [1] https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Richard_Serra\n- [2] https:\/\/www.artforum.com\/features\/due-process-richard-serras-early-splash-cast-works-226187\/\n- [4] https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Richard_Serra\n- [12] https:\/\/www.moma.org\/magazine\/articles\/1063\n\n**Important Note:**\nWhile the inference suggests New York City as the likely location for the creation of \"To Lift,\" it is essential to acknowledge that none of the provided sources directly state the city of creation for this specific work.

However, based on the context and the information given, we can infer the following:\n\n* Dr. William Schwartz, a nephrologist, made a pioneering observation that an antibiotic increased sodium excretion in patients with heart failure, leading to the development of modern diuretic drugs [1].\n* The antibiotic mentioned is not explicitly named in source [1], but given the historical context and the fact that it led to the development of diuretics, we might infer it could be related to sulfonamides, as sulfanilamide is mentioned in [1] in a different context.\n* Sources [2] through [20] primarily discuss Digoxin, a cardiac glycoside used in treating heart failure and atrial fibrillation, but none of these sources directly connect Digoxin to Dr. Schwartz's discovery regarding an antibiotic with diuretic effects in heart failure patients.\n\n**Key Finding:** The direct answer to the question is not available in the provided sources. However, the discovery by Dr. William Schwartz involves an antibiotic (not explicitly named in the sources provided) that has a diuretic effect in patients with congestive heart failure. Given the context, this antibiotic is likely to be sulfanilamide, but this connection is not explicitly confirmed in the sources.\n\n**Recommendation for Further Research:**\nTo accurately answer the question, further research is necessary to identify the specific antibiotic Dr. Schwartz discovered to have diuretic effects.

This is nearly a century after the burial year mentioned in the query (1767). It's likely that the person in question is not buried in this specific cemetery, as it didn't exist at that time.\n\n2. **Lack of relevant information**: None of the sources provide a list of burials from the 18th century or mention an epitaph matching the one in the query. The sources primarily focus on the cemetery's history, notable burials from the 19th and 20th centuries, and ongoing projects related to the cemetery's maintenance and development.\n\nGiven the information gap and the date mismatch, I couldn't find a reliable answer to the user's question based on the provided sources. If more sources or context were available, it might be possible to provide a more accurate response.\n\n**Response:**\nUnfortunately, the provided sources do not contain information about a person buried at Paddington Cemetery in London in 1767, with the specified epitaph.

Although the exact date of Ma's induction ceremony is not specified for him in the sources provided (unlike Harvey Phillips', which is mentioned as June 28, 2008), it is clear that his induction occurred as part of the 2007-08 class.\n\n**Note on Date Specificity:** While the question seeks a specific year, and based on the provided sources, we can confidently assert the induction year as part of the 2007-08 class. However, without a specific ceremony date mentioned for Ma (as opposed to Harvey Phillips' ceremony in 2008), the answer focuses on the class year, implying the induction process occurred within the 2007-2008 timeframe.","enhanced_queries":["Yo-Yo Ma Classical Music Hall of Fame induction year","site:cmhof.org \"Yo-Yo Ma\" induction","\"Classical Music Hall of Fame inductees\" \"Yo-Yo Ma\" year (2025 OR latest OR current)"],"metadata":{"topic":"Music","answer_type":"Date","urls":["https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/American_Classical_Music_Hall_of_Fame_and_Museum","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/American_Classical_Music_Hall_of_Fame_and_Museum","https:\/\/classicalwalkoffame.org\/browse-inductees\/?show_group=year"]},"retrieved_urls":["https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yo-Yo_Ma","http:\/\/www.chicagosinfonietta.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Yo-Yo-Ma-program-book.FINAL_.pdf","https:\/\/news2.rice.edu\/2017\/10\/09\/shepherd-schools-rachleff-inducted-into-american-classical-music-hall-of-fame\/","https:\/\/www.openculture.com\/2021\/10\/three-hours-of-yo-yo-ma-playing-bachs-six-cello-suites.html","https:\/\/www.uc.edu\/news\/articles\/legacy\/enews\/2008\/06\/tuba-virtuoso-harvey-phillips-to-be-inducted-into-american-classical-music-hall-of-fame-june-28in-ccm-ceremony.html"],"search_results":{},"success":true,"error":null,"final_grade":"A"}

However, we can gather some relevant information from the sources:\n\n- Source [5] mentions that after returning to India from Italy in 1924, Amrita joined Jesus and Mary Convent in Shimla, which suggests the family was already residing in Shimla by then.\n- Source [6] states that the Sher-Gill family arrived in Bombay, India, in 1921, after leaving Budapest. It does not specify when they moved to Shimla but indicates they were in India from 1921 onwards.\n- Source [10] provides information about the family's movements but does not specifically mention the year they moved to Summer Hill, Shimla.\n\nGiven the information available, we can infer that Amrita Sher-Gil's family was likely living in Shimla by 1924, as evidenced by Amrita's enrollment in Jesus and Mary Convent that year.

However, none of these sources directly mention the season and episode numbers. \n\nFortunately, source [15] provides contextual information about the events leading up to the conversation, mentioning that Thomas asks Alfie for the names of people in the UK who would be interested in buying Faberge eggs, and later points a gun at Alfie's head, saying he 'crossed the line' by causing his son to be kidnapped. This context is crucial for identifying the correct season and episode.\n\nAfter analyzing the events described in source [15] and cross-referencing them with the overall storyline of Peaky Blinders, it appears that this conversation occurs in **Series 6** of the show. \n\nTo pinpoint the exact episode, let's consider the following:\n\n- Source [1] mentions that in Series 6, Tommy meets up with Alfie one last time after he killed Michael.\n- Source [9] mentions Alfie appearing one last time in Series 6, Lock and Key, which is **Episode 5** of the series.\n\nGiven that the conversation about \"crossing the line\" involves Thomas being angry about his son being kidnapped, and considering the events described in the sources, it's reasonable to deduce that this conversation likely occurs before the events of Lock and Key (Episode 5). \n\nHowever, without an explicit episode number in the provided sources for the \"crossing the line\" conversation, we must rely on contextual clues.

[1]\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe provided sources primarily focus on the life and works of Swiss painter Benjamin Samuel Bolomey. To answer the question, we need to identify the source that mentions Bolomey's relationship with Joseph-Marie Vien.\n\nSource [1] (https:\/\/www.wikiwand.com\/en\/articles\/Benjamin_Samuel_Bolomey) is the most relevant, as it provides a brief biography of Bolomey. According to this source, Bolomey \"became a pupil of Joseph-Marie Vien in 1758\" while studying in Paris between 1752 and 1760.\n\n**Verification:**\nSource [2] (https:\/\/www.invaluable.com\/artist\/bolomey-benjamin-samuel-7ymy32netv\/sold-at-auction-prices\/?srsltid=AfmBOop12fRYjcj5OHP8NdzmXNkNTXbS4LE0E5qWiWpmNgyZcQwg-8WZ) also mentions Bolomey's education in Paris but does not specify the exact year he became Vien's pupil. Instead, it states that Bolomey \"studied in Paris from 1748 at the Acad\u00e9mie Royale de peinture under the guidance of Joseph Marie Vien.\" The discrepancy in dates (1748 vs. 1752) might be due to the sources providing different information about the start of Bolomey's education in Paris. However, only Source [1] explicitly mentions the year 1758 as when Bolomey became Vien's pupil.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the provided sources, the most accurate answer is found in Source [1], which states that Benjamin Samuel Bolomey became a pupil of Joseph-Marie Vien in 1758.","enhanced_queries":["Benjamin Samuel Bolomey pupil of Joseph-Marie Vien year","site:wikipedia.org \"Benjamin Samuel Bolomey\" \"Joseph-Marie Vien\" apprenticeship date","\"Swiss painter\" Bolomey training under Vien late 18th century timeline"],"metadata":{"topic":"Art","answer_type":"Date","urls":["https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Benjamin_Samuel_Bolomey","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Benjamin_Samuel_Bolomey#:~:text=He%20received%20his%20early%20artistic,Joseph%2DMarie%20Vien%20in%201758.","https:\/\/artvee.com\/artist\/benjamin-samuel-bolomey\/"]},"retrieved_urls":["https:\/\/artvee.com\/artist\/benjamin-samuel-bolomey\/","https:\/\/www.invaluable.com\/artist\/bolomey-benjamin-samuel-7ymy32netv\/sold-at-auction-prices\/?srsltid=AfmBOop12fRYjcj5OHP8NdzmXNkNTXbS4LE0E5qWiWpmNgyZcQwg-8WZ","https:\/\/www.wikiwand.com\/en\/articles\/Benjamin_Samuel_Bolomey","https:\/\/artvee.com\/dl\/frederika-sophia-wilhelmina-of-prussia-1751-1820-wife-of-prince-willem-v\/","https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/DGn8oIbI63P\/"],"search_results":{},"success":true,"error":null,"final_grade":"A"}

This event marked the end of his performing career in the United States. \n\n**Note on Source Relevance and Availability of Information:**\nThe information directly answering the query is found in a single source with a high relevance score (0.80). The other sources, while providing valuable context about Gottschalk's life and works, do not mention the specific incident or his subsequent departure from the United States.","enhanced_queries":["Louis Moreau Gottschalk departure from US reason","Oakland Female Seminary scandal Louis Moreau Gottschalk year","site:.edu OR site:.org ","Louis Moreau Gottschalk biography alleged affair student Oakland Female Seminary"],"metadata":{"topic":"Music","answer_type":"Date","urls":["https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Louis_Moreau_Gottschalk","https:\/\/loebjewishportraits.com\/biography\/louis-moreau-gottschalk\/#:~:text=In%201865%20he%20was%20at,the%20country%20and%20never%20returned.","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Louis_Moreau_Gottschalk","https:\/\/interlude.hk\/louis-moreau-gottschalk-composer-of-the-month\/"]},"retrieved_urls":["https:\/\/www.naxos.com\/MainSite\/BlurbsReviews\/?itemcode=8.559693&catnum=559693&filetype=AboutThisRecording&language=English","https:\/\/64parishes.org\/entry\/louis-moreau-gottschalk","https:\/\/www.commentary.org\/articles\/terry-teachout\/our-gottschalk\/","https:\/\/www.americanheritage.com\/chopin-called-him-king-pianists","https:\/\/www.jstor.org\/stable\/739108"],"search_results":{},"success":true,"error":null,"final_grade":"A"}
