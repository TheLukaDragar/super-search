{"case_id":"447c5167-8979-4ceb-a90d-3afa432ad1d3","question":"What was the strike rate of Harbhajan Singh in the final match of IPL 2015?","true_answer":"200.00","pipeline_answer":"**Strike Rate of Harbhajan Singh in the Final Match of IPL 2015**\n\nThe strike rate of Harbhajan Singh in the final match of IPL 2015 can be determined from the provided sources. According to the relevant information:\n\n* **Source [8]** provides the bowling statistics for the final match between Chennai Super Kings and Mumbai Indians on May 24, 2015. Specifically, it mentions Harbhajan Singh's bowling figures as **4 overs, 0 maidens, 34 runs, 2 wickets, and an economy rate of 8.50**.\n\nTo calculate the strike rate, we need the number of balls bowled and the number of wickets taken. Since the economy rate is given as 8.50 runs per over, and assuming a standard over has 6 balls, we can infer the total runs conceded per ball. However, for strike rate, we directly use the overs bowled and wickets taken, given the formula for strike rate in bowling is:\n\n**Strike Rate = (Number of Balls Bowled \/ Number of Wickets Taken) \u00d7 6**\n\nGiven:\n- **Overs Bowled = 4**\n- **Wickets Taken = 2**\n\nFirst, convert overs to balls (since 1 over = 6 balls):\n- **Balls Bowled = Overs Bowled \u00d7 6 = 4 \u00d7 6 = 24 balls**\n\nNow, calculate the strike rate:\n- **Strike Rate = (24 Balls \/ 2 Wickets) \u00d7 6 = 12**\n\nTherefore, the strike rate of Harbhajan Singh in the final match of IPL 2015 was **12**.\n\n**Source Citation for Key Information:**\n[8] https:\/\/www.espncricinfo.com\/series\/pepsi-indian-premier-league-2015-791129\/chennai-super-kings-vs-mumbai-indians-final-829823\/full-scorecard","enhanced_queries":["Harbhajan Singh strike rate IPL 2015 final match","IPL 2015 final match bowling stats Harbhajan Singh","site:espncricinfo.com OR site:cricbuzz.com \"Harbhajan Singh\" IPL 2015 final match strike rate"],"metadata":{"topic":"Sports","answer_type":"Number","urls":["https:\/\/m.cricbuzz.com\/live-cricket-scorecard\/14653\/mi-vs-csk-final-indian-premier-league-2015","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2015_Indian_Premier_League_final","https:\/\/www.espncricinfo.com\/series\/pepsi-indian-premier-league-2015-791129\/chennai-super-kings-vs-mumbai-indians-final-829823\/full-scorecard","https:\/\/www.cricbuzz.com\/live-cricket-scorecard\/14653\/mi-vs-csk-final-indian-premier-league-2015"]},"retrieved_urls":["https:\/\/www.espncricinfo.com\/series\/pepsi-indian-premier-league-2015-791129\/chennai-super-kings-vs-mumbai-indians-final-829823\/match-report","https:\/\/www.espncricinfo.com\/series\/pepsi-indian-premier-league-2015-791129\/mumbai-indians-vs-kings-xi-punjab-7th-match-829717\/full-scorecard","https:\/\/www.espncricinfo.com\/series\/pepsi-indian-premier-league-2015-791129\/chennai-super-kings-vs-mumbai-indians-final-829823\/full-scorecard","https:\/\/www.mykhel.com\/cricket\/players\/harbhajan-singh-ipl-p2138","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Harbhajan_Singh"],"search_results":{},"success":true,"error":null,"final_grade":"B"}

According to these sources, with almost all votes counted:\n\n- Recep Tayyip Erdogan secured **52.55%** of the vote [3] or approximately **53%** as mentioned in [8], with the closest figure to a precise percentage being **52.55%**.\n- Muharrem \u0130nce secured **30.67%** of the vote [3] or **31%** as mentioned in [8], with the closest figure to a precise percentage being **30.67%**.\n\nGiven that the total number of votes is not directly provided in the sources, but we know the turnout was a record high at almost **87%** [10] of the eligible voters, and assuming we're working with percentages of the total vote count, we can calculate the difference in votes based on the percentages, acknowledging that the exact number of votes would depend on the total number of eligible voters and the turnout.\n\nHowever, since we don't have the exact total number of votes cast, we'll calculate the percentage point difference which directly translates to the percentage of total votes difference:\n\n**Difference in Percentage Points = Erdogan's Percentage - \u0130nce's Percentage**\n**= 52.55% - 30.67%**\n**= 21.88 Percentage Points**\n\nTo find out how many more votes Erdogan got than \u0130nce in terms of the total vote count, we would ideally multiply this percentage difference by the total number of votes cast. Unfortunately, without the exact total vote count provided in the sources, we can't calculate the exact numerical difference in votes. However, the **21.88 percentage point difference** is the key figure indicating how much more of the total vote share Erdogan received compared to \u0130nce.\n\n**If you had the total vote count (e.g., from an external source), you could calculate the exact difference in votes as follows:**\n**Difference in Votes = (Difference in Percentage Points \/ 100) * Total Votes Cast**\n\nSince we're constrained by the information provided and the format requires a precise answer which we cannot fully calculate without the total vote count, I'll emphasize the core of the calculation we can derive from the given sources:\n\n**The winning candidate, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, received 21.88 percentage points more of the total vote share than Muharrem \u0130nce.**\n\n**Source Citations for Key Figures:**\n- [3] for **52.55% (Erdogan)** and **30.67% (\u0130nce)**\n- [8] for **53% (Erdogan)** and **31% (\u0130nce)**, used for secondary confirmation\n- [10] for **87% turnout**, indicating a high participation rate but not directly used in our calculation due to the lack of total eligible voters for a precise vote count.","enhanced_queries":["Turkey 2018 presidential election results: Muharrem \u0130nce vs winning candidate vote difference","site:tr.wikipedia.org \"2018 T\u00fcrkiye cumhurba\u015fkanl\u0131\u011f\u0131 se\u00e7imi\" Muharrem \u0130nce oy fark\u0131","\"June 24, 2018 Turkish presidential election\" winner vote margin over Muharrem \u0130nce filetype:pdf OR filetype:doc OR filetype:csv"],"metadata":{"topic":"Politics","answer_type":"Number","urls":["https:\/\/ysk.gov.tr\/doc\/dosyalar\/Ingilizce\/ElectionResults\/2018CB-416D_en.pdf","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2018_Muharrem_%C4%B0nce_presidential_campaign"]},"retrieved_urls":["https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-europe-44596072","https:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/news\/2018\/6\/25\/turkey-elections-2018-all-the-latest-updates","https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2018\/jun\/25\/turkey-elections-result-erdogan-amnesty-was-vote-free-and-fair","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2018_Turkish_presidential_election","https:\/\/www.setav.org\/en\/assets\/uploads\/2018\/08\/R117.pdf"],"search_results":{},"success":true,"error":null,"final_grade":"C"}

However, I can guide you through the relevant information found in the sources that might be related to your query:\n\n- **Source [1]** mentions \"Floaty Jerry\" in the context of a clip from Season 6, Episode 5, titled \"Final DeSmithation.\" However, there's no explicit description of Jerry floating for 10 hours in this source.\n\n- **Sources [2-9]** and **[11-17]** provide lists of episodes from various seasons, but none directly reference a scene with Jerry floating for 10 hours or explicitly mention \"Floaty Jerry\" as an episode title.\n\n- **Source [10]** lists episodes from different seasons, including \"Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate\" (Season 2, Episode 8), which involves Jerry getting sick and Rick using the TV. While this episode involves Jerry and has a somewhat related premise, there's no clear indication that it's the episode with Jerry floating for 10 hours.\n\n- **Sources [12]** and **[16]** discuss \"The Jerrick Trap,\" an episode from Season 7.

Alternatively, consulting a more comprehensive Rick and Morty episode guide or database might yield the specific information you're seeking.\n\n**Recommendation for Further Action:**\n- Consult a detailed Rick and Morty episode guide or wiki that might have more specific scene descriptions.\n- Check fan forums or discussion boards where fans might have analyzed scenes in greater detail.\n- If available, review episode summaries or transcripts for mentions of the described scene.","enhanced_queries":["Rick and Morty Jerry floating episode season number title","site:adultswim.com \"Jerry floats for 10 hours\" Rick and Morty episode guide","\"Rick and Morty\" episode with 10-hour floating Jerry scene season episode title"],"metadata":{"topic":"TV shows","answer_type":"Other","urls":["https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rattlestar_Ricklactica","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rattlestar_Ricklactica#:~:text=4%20Reception-,Plot,to%20jump%20higher%20than%20usual.","https:\/\/rickandmorty.fandom.com\/wiki\/Rattlestar_Ricklactica#:~:text=Broadcast%20Information&text=%22Rattlestar%20Ricklactica%22%20is%20the%20fifth,and%20directed%20by%20Jacob%20Hair."]},"retrieved_urls":["https:\/\/rickandmorty.fandom.com\/wiki\/Solaricks","https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt5218310","https:\/\/www.adultswim.com\/videos\/rick-and-morty\/floaty-jerry","https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt5218370","https:\/\/rickandmorty.fandom.com\/wiki\/The_Jerrick_Trap"],"search_results":{},"success":true,"error":null,"final_grade":"C"}

This indicates that, as of March 2016, human trials for at least one vaccine candidate were anticipated to begin within the same year.\n  \n- **Phase I Clinical Studies:** It was anticipated that many vaccine candidates would enter **Phase I clinical studies in 2017** [11]. This suggests that, as of March 2016, the expectation was for clinical trials to progress into 2017, implying that wide availability would likely be beyond 2017, considering the typical timeline for vaccine development, testing, and approval.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAs of March 2016, 18 companies and institutions were developing Zika vaccines, with human trials for some candidates expected to start later in 2016 and many others anticipated to enter Phase I clinical studies in 2017.

However, the provided sources primarily discuss the development and first flight of the **prototypes and earlier models** of the Bell UH-1 series, such as the XH-40 (prototype for the UH-1 series), Model 204, and UH-1B, rather than the UH-1H specifically.\n\n**Relevant Information from Sources:**\n\n* The **XH-40 prototype** (for the UH-1 series) first flew on **October 20, 1956** [1, 4, 5, 7].\n* **Model 205**, which is more closely related to the UH-1H (as it's a stretched version of the Iroquois), first flew in **August 1961** [4, 8].\n* **UH-1B**, an earlier model, started Army testing in **November 1960**, with first production delivery in **March 1961** [10].\n* **Specific to UH-1H**: The sources [13, 15] provide details on the UH-1H's specifications and upgrades but do not explicitly mention the first flight date of the UH-1H.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nGiven the information provided in the sources, **there is no explicit mention of the first flight date specifically for the Bell UH-1H Iroquois**.

For definitive information, I recommend consulting the official 2022 festival archives or contacting the organizers directly.\n\n**Sources Cited (Relevant to the Query but Lacking Specific Composer Information):**\n[1], [4] - For context on the play \"Helen\" and the festival.\n**All other sources** - For general festival information, unrelated to the specific query about \"Helen's\" musical composition.","enhanced_queries":["musical composition \"Helen\" play 2022 Athens Epidaurus Festival","composer of \"Helen\" theatrical production Athens Epidaurus Festival 2022","site:epidaurusfestival.gr \"Helen\" 2022 musical score composer"],"metadata":{"topic":"Art","answer_type":"Person","urls":["https:\/\/aefestival.gr\/festival_events\/eleni\/?lang=en","https:\/\/www.ntng.gr\/default.aspx?lang=en-GB&page=2&production=53320","https:\/\/aefestival.gr\/festival_events\/eleni\/?lang=en","https:\/\/hellenica.fr\/externe\/PRESS-KIT-ENGLISH-4.4.2022_.pdf"]},"retrieved_urls":["https:\/\/aefestival.gr\/festival_events\/eleni?lang=en","https:\/\/cit.gr\/en\/events\/%CF%86%CE%B5%CF%83%CF%84%CE%B9%CE%B2%CE%AC%CE%BB-%CE%B1%CE%B8%CE%B7%CE%BD%CF%8E%CE%BD-%CE%BA%CE%B1%CE%B9-%CE%B5%CF%80%CE%B9%CE%B4%CE%B1%CF%8D%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%85-2024-to-%CF%80%CF%81%CF%8C%CE%B3%CF%81","https:\/\/www.ntng.gr?lang=en-GB&page=2&production=53320","https:\/\/aefestival.gr\/anakoinosi-open-plan-2022?lang=en","https:\/\/hellenica.fr\/externe\/PRESS-KIT-ENGLISH-4.4.2022_.pdf"],"search_results":{},"success":true,"error":null,"final_grade":"C"}

Rey y Besadre** [3, 4] or **J. L. Ruiz Basadre** [1, 2], with the sources providing two different names for the initial architect. It was modeled after the Palais des Glaces in Paris.\n\n- **Redesign for New Purposes (1931):** Later, in 1931, the architect **Alejandro Bustillo** redesigned the building to accommodate the National Commission of Fine Arts, transforming its circular halls into exhibition spaces [3, 4]. Bustillo's redesign enabled the Palais de Glace to serve its current function as an exhibition center and cultural hub.\n\n**Note on Architect's Name Discrepancy:**\nThere is a discrepancy in the sources regarding the name of the initial architect, with **J.

You're the navigator\"?","true_answer":"Season 2, Episode 2 \"Invasion\"","pipeline_answer":"**Vikings Episode Identification**\n\nBased on the provided sources, the quote \"I build boats, Ragnar. You're the navigator\" is attributed to Floki, but unfortunately, none of the sources directly mention the season number, episode number, and title of the specific episode where this quote is said. However, we can attempt to narrow down the possibilities.\n\n**Indirect Clues:**\n\n1. **Source [1]** mentions the quote in the context of \"Invasion,\" but without specifying if \"Invasion\" is the episode title, and if so, its corresponding season and episode numbers.\n2. **Sources [4]**, **[5]**, and others repeat the quote but do not provide episode-specific information.\n3. **Sources [6]** and **[7]** describe scenes involving Floki and his shipbuilding, which might contextually relate to the quote, but they do not directly link to the quote's episode.\n\n**Potential Episodes Based on Context:**\n\nGiven the context of shipbuilding and the relationship between Floki and Ragnar, the quote might be from early seasons when the focus was on their preparations for raids to the west. \n\n- **Season 1** is a possibility due to the emphasis on Floki's shipbuilding for Ragnar's westward voyage. However, without a direct episode title or number, pinpointing is challenging.\n- **Specific Episodes** like \"The Profit and the Loss\" (Season 4) are mentioned in various sources, but there's no direct link to the quote in question.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- **Season Number:** Possibly Season 1, based on contextual clues about shipbuilding and early westward voyage preparations.\n- **Episode Number and Title:** Unable to determine with certainty from the provided sources. The closest hint is \"Invasion\" from **Source [1]**, but this requires further confirmation.\n\n**Recommendation for Further Research:**\n\nTo accurately identify the episode, consulting a detailed, episode-by-episode quote database for \"Vikings\" or transcripts from Season 1 episodes focusing on Floki's shipbuilding would be advisable.","enhanced_queries":["Vikings episode with quote \"I build boats, Ragnar.

Yet, considering the general understanding and for simplicity, the age gap is frequently rounded to **30 years** as mentioned in some sources [4, 9], reflecting the difference between a person in their mid-forties and one just entering adulthood.\n\n**Source Citations for Key Points:**\n\n[1] - https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ellen_Terry  \n[4] - https:\/\/victorianweb.org\/painting\/watts\/drawings\/2.html  \n[6] - https:\/\/www.npg.org.uk\/collections\/search\/portrait\/mw06269\/Ellen-Terry-Choosing  \n[9] - https:\/\/www.npg.org.uk\/collections\/search\/portraitExtended\/mw06269\/Ellen-Terry-Choosing","enhanced_queries":["George Frederic Watts Ellen Terry age difference","Age gap between George Frederic Watts and Ellen Terry marriage","George Frederic Watts biography \"first marriage\" Ellen Terry \"age at marriage\""],"metadata":{"topic":"Art","answer_type":"Number","urls":["https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/George_Frederic_Watts","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ellen_Terry","https:\/\/www.npg.org.uk\/collections\/search\/portraitExtended\/mw06269\/Ellen-Terry-Choosing","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/George_Frederic_Watts"]},"retrieved_urls":["https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/File:Dame_(Alice)_Ellen_Terry_(%27Choosing%27)_by_George_Frederic_Watts.jpg","https:\/\/www.npg.org.uk\/collections\/search\/portrait\/mw06269\/Ellen-Terry-Choosing","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ellen_Terry","https:\/\/victorianweb.org\/painting\/watts\/drawings\/2.html","https:\/\/www.npg.org.uk\/collections\/search\/portraitExtended\/mw06269\/Ellen-Terry-Choosing"],"search_results":{},"success":true,"error":null,"final_grade":"A"}

He is described as the first educated and scientific German surgeon, a prominent scholar in the iatromechanics school, and the author of 20 medical books [1, 2].\n\n2. **Wilhelm Fabricius von Hilden (Guilhelmus Fabricius Hildanus) (1560-1634)**: Sources [3], [4], [6], [10], [13], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], and [20] refer to Wilhelm Fabricius von Hilden as the \"Father of German Surgery\". He is noted for his pioneering work in surgery, including the first classification of burns into three degrees, and his contributions to neurosurgery [3, 18].\n\n**Clarification:** Both surgeons share the same birth year (1560) and are associated with significant contributions to German surgery, which might explain the dual attribution. However, the more detailed and direct references to Wilhelm Fabricius von Hilden's surgical innovations and his title as \"Father of German Surgery\" across a broader range of sources ([3, 4, 6, 10, 13, 15-20]) slightly outweigh the mentions of Wilhelm Fabry ([1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 14]). Therefore, based on the provided context and the depth of information:\n\n- **Primary Answer:** Wilhelm Fabricius von Hilden (Guilhelmus Fabricius Hildanus) is often called the \"Father of German Surgery\" [3, 4, 6, 10, 13, 15-20].\n- **Secondary Answer:** Wilhelm Fabry is also referred to as the \"Father of German surgery\" in several sources [1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 14], though with slightly less emphasis on pioneering surgical techniques compared to Fabricius von Hilden. \n\n**Recommendation for Future Queries:** To avoid ambiguity, consider specifying the area of contribution (e.g., neurosurgery, general surgery) or provide more context about the \"Father of German Surgery\" you are inquiring about.","enhanced_queries":["Which German surgeon is often called the father of German surgery?"],"metadata":{"topic":"History","answer_type":"Person","urls":["https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wilhelm_Fabry","https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/22246340\/#:~:text=Introduction%3A%20Wilhelm%20Fabricius%20von%20Hilden,the%20father%20of%20German%20surgery.","https:\/\/litfl.com\/wilhelm-fabricius-von-hilden\/","https:\/\/www.encyclopedia.com\/science\/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps\/wilhelm-fabricius-hildanus"]},"retrieved_urls":["https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wilhelm_Fabry","https:\/\/litfl.com\/wilhelm-fabricius-von-hilden","https:\/\/hekint.org\/2017\/01\/22\/fabricius-hildanus-father-of-german-surgery","https:\/\/www.sciencesource.com\/1500161-wilhelm-fabry-german-surgeon.html","https:\/\/www.album-online.com\/detail\/en\/NzM2ODIwMA\/wilhelm-fabry-1560-1634-bern-often-called-father-german-surgery-alb3804207"],"search_results":{},"success":true,"error":null,"final_grade":"A"}

Elsie Lovelock) [3].\n\n**Source Citation:** The information is directly sourced from Musixmatch, specifically from the song's page, which mentions the song title, artist collaboration, and release year [3].\n\n**Contextual Relevance:** The question's context is about a specific collaboration between artists on a song related to Hazbin Hotel, and the provided sources primarily revolve around the song \"Heaven 2 Hell\" by Black Gryph0n, Baasik, and Elsie Lovelock. The song's lyrics and metadata available across the sources [1-7, 13, 20] indirectly support the collaboration aspect and the song's theme related to Hazbin Hotel, with an explicit mention of Alastor in the song's intro [1]. However, the direct answer to the question (song title and year) is most clearly supported by source [3], which explicitly states the song title and release year.\n\n**Agreements\/Differences Between Sources:** All relevant sources agree on the song title, artist collaboration, and the fact that it's related to Hazbin Hotel. The primary difference lies in the depth of information provided, with sources [1, 2, 4] focusing more on the song's lyrics and sources [3, 5, 20] providing more metadata (release year, contributors, etc.).

The sources primarily focus on the anime's episode guides, music reviews, and general information about the series \"Carole & Tuesday\" (2019).\n\nHowever, we can gather some context about Tuesday's decision to run away from home. According to source [8] (id=8, relevance=0.54), Tuesday, the daughter of a well-to-do family from Hershell City, runs away from home and comes to Alba City with the dream of becoming a musician. This suggests that her motivation for leaving home is her passion for music, but the exact song that inspired this decision remains unspecified in the provided sources.\n\n**Insight into Tuesday's Musical Inspirations:**\n\nWhile we cannot pinpoint the exact song, source [4] (id=4, relevance=0.58) mentions that the episode title \"Fire and Rain\" is inspired by James Taylor's song, which discusses themes of perseverance, depression, and overcoming adversity. Although this song is not directly linked to Tuesday's decision to run away, it indicates the show's use of music as a narrative device to explore characters' emotions and motivations.\n\n**Source Citations for Context:**\n\n[4] - Beneath the Tangles: Carole & Tuesday, Episode 3 - Fire and Rain\n[8] - Carole & Tuesday Fandom Wiki: List of Episodes (April 10, 2019, entry)\n\n**Uncertainty Statement:**\n\nDue to the lack of explicit information in the provided sources, I cannot accurately identify the song title and artist that inspired Tuesday to run away from home to pursue music.

However, none of these sources directly address the question of who preceded him as governor.\n\n- Source [1], which is about the Governor of Buenos Aires Province, lists the current governor (as of 2019) and provides general requirements for the office but does not offer a comprehensive list of past governors or their succession order that would answer the question.\n\n- Sources [2] to [13] are primarily from Wikidata and focus on Oscar Alende's biography, providing details on his life, work, and various identifiers (e.g., VIAF, Library of Congress authority ID).

Being midway between Bunbury and Busselton helps narrow down the possibilities, but without exact distances between these towns in the provided sources, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact location.\n   \n2. **Wardandi Noongar People**: The mention of the Wardandi Noongar people is crucial.

However, Cowaramup's distance from Perth and its positioning relative to Bunbury and Busselton are not explicitly provided in the sources to confirm it as the midpoint.\n\n3. **Potential Towns**: Based on the distances provided in source [1], potential towns that could be around the 212 km mark from Perth include:\n   - **Bunbury** (180 km south of Perth, so slightly closer than the target distance)\n   - **Busselton** (230 km south of Perth, placing the midpoint somewhat closer to Bunbury than the exact midpoint would suggest)\n   - Other towns like **Cowaramup**, **Dunsborough**, and **Yallingup** are in the region but lack specific distance information in the provided sources to accurately assess their positioning relative to the 212 km and midpoint criteria.\n\n**Recommendation for Further Research**:\n- Consult a detailed map of Western Australia's Southwest region to accurately measure distances between Bunbury, Busselton, and surrounding towns.\n- Research historical and indigenous resources to find which specific town midway between Bunbury and Busselton was originally inhabited by the Wardandi Noongar people.\n\n**Response Based on Provided Sources**:\nGiven the constraints of the provided sources, I cannot accurately identify the town that meets all specified criteria.

However, several sources hint at transactions involving Correggio's works and Augustus III of Poland around that time. Here's a synthesized overview of the relevant information:\n\n* **Source [2]** mentions that the picture (unspecified title) appeared in the Estense collection, where it remained for over a century, until the sale made by Francesco III to Augustus III, King of Poland, and Elector of Saxony, in the summer of 1746.\n* **Source [4]** discusses \"THE MADONNA WITH ST. JEROME\" but does not confirm its sale to Augustus III in 1746. Instead, it suggests negotiations for the sale of \"the picture\" (again, unspecified) between the Conte Anguissola and a foreign potentate, possibly the King of Poland, for 14,000 sequins.\n* **Source [19]** provides a chronicle entry from December 5, 1749, mentioning the removal of a Correggio picture from Sant' Antonio, reportedly due to a contract with the King of Poland for 14,000 sequins plus a present. This, however, is dated after 1746.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile the sources confirm that Augustus III of Poland did purchase works by Correggio around 1746, the specific piece of art bought in that year is not clearly identified across the provided texts. Possible candidates mentioned in the context of sales or negotiations around that time include \"The Virgin\" (Source [1]), \"THE MADONNA WITH ST. JEROME\" (Source [4], though not confirmed for 1746), and an unnamed Correggio picture (Sources [2] and [19], the latter dated 1749).\n\n**Recommended Further Research:**\nFor a definitive answer, consulting additional sources or art historical records from the Dresden Gallery (mentioned in Source [1] as the destination of the purchased artwork) might provide the specific title of the Correggio piece acquired by Augustus III in 1746.\n\n**Supported Statements:**\n\n* Augustus III of Poland purchased artworks by Antonio da Correggio around 1746. [1, 2, 4]\n* The transaction involved the Dresden Gallery. [1]\n* A Correggio piece was subject to a sale negotiation\/reportedly sold for 14,000 sequins plus a present around the late 1740s.

However, some sources offer related information that might be helpful in understanding the lake's dimensions and changes:\n\n* **Altitude and Potential Depth**: Source [1] mentions that Wular Lake lies at an altitude of 1,580 meters. While this is not the depth, it gives an idea of the lake's elevation.\n* **Depth for Navigation**: Source [6] and [7] discuss the need for a minimum depth of water (specifically, a minimum draught of 4.5 feet or approximately 1.4 meters) in the river up to Baramulla during the lean winter months for navigation purposes. This, however, is not the depth of the lake itself.\n* **Storage Capacity and Depth Considerations for Hydro Power**: Source [4] and [5] talk about increasing the lake's storage capacity up to 1580 m MSL (Mean Sea Level) for a hydro power plant, with a deepened river bed level potentially below 1,570 m MSL for 4,000 cusecs flow. This implies considerations for depth in the context of water storage and power generation but does not provide a straightforward answer to the lake's current depth.\n* **Lake Degradation**: Sources [12] and [13] mention that parts of the lake have become shallow due to waste and mud buildup, indicating a reduction in depth in certain areas over time. However, no specific depth measurements are provided.\n\n**Conclusion**: \nGiven the information available across all sources, there is no direct mention of Wular Lake's current depth in meters.

However, this planned discontinuation by 2006 was preempted by the actual discontinuation in May 2000.\n\n**Clarification on the Query:**\nGiven the query specifies the discontinuation as a result of the 1996 executive order, the accurate response to the date, month, and year of discontinuation based on that order's original intent would be **by 2006**.

However, based on the information from sources [1] and [4], we can infer the release year.\n\nSource [1] mentions that \"Taikutsu Shinogi\" was released on May 9, 2012, but this is in the context of the song, not explicitly stated as the release date of the single. \n\nSource [4] lists the discography of Kinoko Teikoku, including the singles.

The release date for this mini album is stated as May 9, 2012. While this does not directly confirm \"Taikutsu Shinogi\" as a single, it does establish that the song was part of a release in 2012.\n\nConsidering the information from these sources, it can be inferred that \"Taikutsu Shinogi\" was indeed part of a 2012 release, although the specific nature of this release (single, part of an EP, etc.) is not universally clear across all sources. Given the direct mention of a release in 2012 in sources [1], [4], and the album context in [6], we can conclude the year of release with a reasonable degree of certainty.\n\n**Answer:** The year Kinoko Teikoku released their song \"Taikutsu Shinogi\" (\u9000\u5c48\u3057\u306e\u304e) is 2012.

This suggests that the paper explores semantic maps within the context of emotions, but without direct reference to Figure 4's content, we cannot confirm if emotions are the specific notion dedicated to in Figure 4.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nGiven the information gap regarding the specific content of Figure 4, we cannot accurately determine the notion to which the lexical semantic map in Figure 4 is dedicated based on the provided sources. If Figure 4 is indeed related to the mention of a lexical semantic map in Source [1], \"breathe\" might be a relevant notion, but this is speculative without direct confirmation.

However, based on the information available, we can identify some key recipients who are relevant to the context of art and visual expression:\n\n* **Max Tau** (1950) was the first person awarded the Peace Prize, but the sources primarily describe him in the context of literature and his work towards reconciliation and peace, without explicitly highlighting him as a visual artist [3, 10, 13].\n* **Sebasti\u00e3o Salgado** (2019) is mentioned as a \"visual artist\" who was awarded the Peace Prize for his photographic work, which calls for social justice and peace, and highlights the importance of nature and climate protection [3].

Further historical research or consultation of more specific sources would be necessary to answer this question definitively.\n\n**Sources Cited (Relevant to the Query)**\n\n[1] https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_attorneys_general_of_Argentina  \n[2] https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_attorneys_general_of_Argentina (Duplicate URL with slightly different content relevance)  \n\n**Note**: The other sources ([3] to [20]) are not directly relevant to identifying the inaugural Attorney General of Argentina.","enhanced_queries":["inaugural Attorney General of Argentina","first holder of Argentina Attorney General position site:gov.ar OR site:wikipedia.org","\"Attorney General of Argentina\" origins history \"first appointment\" filetype:pdf OR filetype:doc"],"metadata":{"topic":"Politics","answer_type":"Person","urls":["https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_attorneys_general_of_Argentina","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_attorneys_general_of_Argentina","https:\/\/www.kierjoffe.com\/news\/lawyer-argentina-attorney-buenos-aires-law-firm\/argentina-attorney-general\/","https:\/\/buenosaires.gob.ar\/procuracion-general\/la-abogacia-publica"]},"retrieved_urls":["https:\/\/www.timesofisrael.com\/liveblog_entry\/argentine-president-elect-taps-ex-nazi-youth-as-attorney-general-of-treasury","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_attorneys_general_of_Argentina","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Alejandra_Gils_Carb%C3%B3","https:\/\/www.detailedpedia.com\/wiki-List_of_attorneys_general_of_Argentina","https:\/\/www.batimes.com.ar\/news\/argentina\/rodolfo-barra-former-menem-official-with-nazi-past-chosen-as-treasury-attorney-general.phtml"],"search_results":{},"success":true,"error":null,"final_grade":"C"}

However, we can identify which theories are associated with physiological responses that resemble the fight-or-flight response.\n\n* **Cannon-Bard Theory [1, 12]**: This theory proposes that emotions result from simultaneous physiological and emotional experiences. While it doesn't explicitly introduce the fight-or-flight response, it does involve physiological reactions that could be related to such a response.\n* **Cognitive Appraisal Theory [2]**: This theory mentions the fight-or-flight response in the context of encountering a bear, leading to fear and physical reactions. However, it doesn't propose the concept but rather uses it to illustrate the theory's sequence of events.\n* **Evolutionary Theory of Emotion [3]**: This theory discusses the adaptive role of emotions, including fear compelling individuals to \"fight or flee.\" Again, it doesn't propose the fight-or-flight response as part of its core but acknowledges the behavior as an evolutionary adaptation.\n\n**Conclusion**: Based on the provided sources, **none directly propose the fight-or-flight response as a core concept of their theory**. However, the **Cannon-Bard Theory [1, 12]** is most closely related to physiological responses akin to the fight-or-flight response, as it emphasizes the simultaneous occurrence of physiological and emotional experiences.

However, the exact number of genes with mutations directly associated with endometriosis development is not explicitly stated in the provided sources.\n\n**Rationale and Source Citation:**\n\n- The sources consistently mention the discovery of up to 27 significant loci associated with endometriosis through GWAS [1, 3, 11]. \n- These loci are associated with various biological functions and genes, including those involved in steroidogenesis, inflammation, immune response, neoangiogenesis, DNA repair, metabolism regulation, and cell growth [1, 3].\n- While specific genes are mentioned in the context of endometriosis (e.g., ESR1, CYP19A1, HSD17B1, VEGF, and GnRH) [15], the sources do not provide a comprehensive, numbered list of genes with mutations directly linked to endometriosis development.\n- The complexity of genetic contributions to endometriosis, including the involvement of rare genetic variants and the missing heritability of the disorder, is highlighted [13], suggesting that the genetic landscape of endometriosis is not fully elucidated by the provided sources.\n\n**Key Sources for the Answer:**\n\n[1] https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/332025402_Genetics_of_endometriosis_a_comprehensive_review  \n[3] https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/332025402_Genetics_of_endometriosis_a_comprehensive_review  \n[11] https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/332025402_Genetics_of_endometriosis_a_comprehensive_review  \n[13] https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/332025402_Genetics_of_endometriosis_a_comprehensive_review  \n[15] https:\/\/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/articles\/PMC10340419  \n\n**Uncertainty\/Gaps in Information:**\nThe provided sources do not offer a direct, explicit answer to the question regarding the exact number of genes with mutations associated with endometriosis development.

Notably, [3] does mention a \"2002 - Ronald Breslow\" recipient, but this is for Bioinorganic or Bioorganic Chemistry, not Organic Chemistry.\n- Sources [6] and [11] are relevant as they discuss the Bader Award for organic chemistry. However, [6] does not provide a list of winners, and [11] lists winners from 2002 onwards but only for the Royal Society of Chemistry's Bader Award, which might not be the same as the one mentioned in the query. According to [11], the 2002 winner of the RSC's Bader Award is Dr. Stuart G. Warren, but without further confirmation, it's unclear if this is the exact award in question.\n\n**Uncertainty:**\nGiven the information available, there is uncertainty about the specific Bader Award for Organic Chemistry winner in 2002. If the award in question is indeed the one given by the Royal Society of Chemistry, then the winner could be Dr. Stuart G. Warren [11]. However, without explicit confirmation across sources that this is the same award, the answer remains uncertain.\n\n**Recommendation for Further Inquiry:**\nTo accurately determine the winner of the Bader Award for Organic Chemistry in 2002, it is recommended to consult the official website of the awarding body (if specified in the context, which in this case seems to be potentially the Czech Chemical Society for one of the mentioned awards) or contact them directly for the most accurate and up-to-date information.","enhanced_queries":["Bader Award for Organic Chemistry 2002 winner surname","site:royalsociety.org \"Bader Award for Organic Chemistry\" 2002 recipient","\"Bader Award winners by year\" \"Organic Chemistry\" 2002 laureate surname"],"metadata":{"topic":"Science and technology","answer_type":"Person","urls":["https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bader_Award#:~:text=2002,Stuart%20Warren","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bader_Award","https:\/\/www.rsc.org\/prizes-funding\/prizes\/find-a-prize\/bader-award\/previous-winners\/","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Stuart_Warren"]},"retrieved_urls":["https:\/\/www.rsc.org\/prizes-funding\/prizes\/find-a-prize\/bader-award\/previous-winners","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bader_Award","https:\/\/www.acs.org\/funding\/awards\/alfred-bader-award-in-bioinorganic-or-bioorganic-chemistry\/past-recipients.html","https:\/\/www.obfch.cz\/en\/awards\/alfred-bader","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Alfred_Bader"],"search_results":{},"success":true,"error":null,"final_grade":"C"}

However, based on the information available, we can deduce the following:\n\n- Syngman Rhee, the first president of South Korea, was born on March 26, 1875, before the founding of South Korea in 1948 [2, 4, 12].\n- The list of presidents provided in the sources does not include birthdates for all presidents, but it does list the presidents in chronological order [1, 7, 9].\n- To find the first president born after the founding of South Korea, we would need to examine the birthdates of the presidents who served after Syngman Rhee.\n\n**Available Birth Information for Subsequent Presidents:**\n\n- Unfortunately, the provided sources do not offer comprehensive birthdate information for all presidents of South Korea.\n- However, we can look at the more recent presidents, assuming they are more likely to have been born after 1948.\n\n**Recent Presidents with Available Information:**\n\n- **Yoon Suk-Yeol** (2022\u2013 ): No birthdate provided in the sources, but according to external knowledge (not provided in the sources), Yoon Suk-Yeol was born on December 18, 1960, which is after the founding of South Korea.\n- **Moon Jae-In** (2017\u201322): No specific birthdate in the provided sources, but external information (not in the sources) indicates he was born on January 24, 1953, also after the founding.\n- **Park Geun-Hye** (2013\u201317): Born on February 2, 1952, according to external information not provided in the sources, which is after the founding.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the information not directly provided in the sources but inferred from the context and external knowledge, **Yoon Suk-Yeol** or any other president born after 1948 could be considered the first South Korean president to be born after the founding of South Korea. However, without explicit birthdate information for all presidents in the provided sources, pinpointing the very first one solely based on these sources is challenging. Given the constraints, the most direct answer we can provide from the context (but requiring external verification for birthdates) would suggest looking towards more recent presidents like Yoon Suk-Yeol or Moon Jae-In, with Yoon Suk-Yeol being a potential answer if we consider the need for a birthdate after 1948.\n\n**Source Citations for Contextual Information:**\n[1], [2], [4], [7], [9], [12] (Note: Specific citations for birthdates of recent presidents are not provided as the exact information is not available within the given sources.)","enhanced_queries":["first South Korean president born after 1948","site:.gov.kr OR site:.kr \"South Korean presidents\" birthdate > 1948","\"post-1948 birth\" South Korea president list OR \"youngest born presidents\" South Korea biography"],"metadata":{"topic":"Politics","answer_type":"Person","urls":["https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Park_Geun-hye","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Park_Geun-hye","https:\/\/artsandculture.google.com\/entity\/m0760zn?hl=it"]},"retrieved_urls":["https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/biography\/Syngman-Rhee","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Syngman_Rhee","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_presidents_of_South_Korea","https:\/\/digitalarchive.wilsoncenter.org\/people\/rhee-syngman","https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/topic\/list-of-presidents-of-South-Korea-2050294"],"search_results":{},"success":true,"error":null,"final_grade":"C"}

Saffron is often referred to with terms that highlight its valuable and vibrant color, but \"Golden Zest\" is not a commonly used term in the provided academic and informative sources.\n\n- **Saffron's Association with \"Golden\" Terminology:** While saffron is indeed known for its golden-colored stigmas, the term \"Golden Zest\" is not found in the references provided. Saffron is sometimes associated with golden terminology due to its color and value, but this specific term does not appear to be standard in the literature about Indian agriculture or saffron production.\n\n- **Sources' Focus:** The sources primarily discuss saffron's cultivation, particularly in the Kashmir region of India, its production, quality enhancement, and the challenges faced by the saffron industry. None of these sources mention \"Golden Zest\" in the context of Indian agriculture.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Without explicit mention in the provided sources, it's challenging to definitively identify \"Golden Zest\" with a specific Indian agriculture product. Given the emphasis on saffron, one might speculate that saffron could be the subject due to its golden stigmas, but the term \"Golden Zest\" itself is not supported by the provided literature.\n\n**Sources Cited:**\nNone directly applicable, as \"Golden Zest\" is not mentioned in the provided sources.\n\n**Recommendation for Further Inquiry:**\nTo accurately answer the question, additional sources or context that directly mention \"Golden Zest\" in relation to Indian agriculture would be necessary.","enhanced_queries":["Indian agriculture known as Golden Zest","Golden Zest crop OR produce OR farming in India","site:gov.in OR site:.ac.in \"Golden Zest\" India agriculture sector -definition -wiki"],"metadata":{"topic":"Geography","answer_type":"Other","urls":["https:\/\/www.dailyexcelsior.com\/saffron-farming-in-jk\/","https:\/\/www.dailyexcelsior.com\/saffron-cultivation-in-kishtwar\/","https:\/\/justagriculture.in\/files\/newsletter\/2023\/june\/45.%20Indoor%20Saffron%20Production%20-%20How%20and%20Why.pdf","https:\/\/kashmirtravels.com\/tours\/kashmir-saffron-harvest-tour.html"]},"retrieved_urls":["https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007\/978-981-19-3728-6_35","https:\/\/www.dailyexcelsior.com\/saffron-cultivation-in-kishtwar","https:\/\/iiim.res.in\/saffron-production","https:\/\/www.dailyexcelsior.com\/saffron-farming-in-jk","https:\/\/justagriculture.in\/files\/newsletter\/2023\/june\/45.%20Indoor%20Saffron%20Production%20-%20How%20and%20Why.pdf"],"search_results":{},"success":true,"error":null,"final_grade":"C"}

However, by compiling information from the most relevant sources ([1], [2], [14], [15], [18], and [19]), we can deduce the correct answer.\n\nHere's a brief overview of the EGOT winners mentioned in the sources, in the order they appear or are implied to be sequential (though not all sources provide a comprehensive, ordered list):\n\n1. **Richard Rodgers** ([19]) - First EGOT winner\n2. **Helen Hayes** ([1]) - Second EGOT winner\n...\n3. **Robert Lopez** ([16]) - Youngest EGOT winner, also mentioned as achieving EGOT status at a notable point\n...\n7. **Richard Rodgers (again, for context)** ([19])\n9. **Elton John** ([15]) - Joined EGOT in 2024\n14. **John Legend** ([18]) - First Black man to achieve EGOT in 2018\n\nGiven the provided information and focusing on the question about the **tenth EGOT winner**, we must look for any source that either directly mentions the tenth winner or provides enough context to infer the correct answer. Unfortunately, none of the sources directly state, \"This is the tenth EGOT winner.\" However, we can piece together information to find the answer.\n\n**Sources [4]** and **[15]** provide crucial information. **Source [4]** mentions Benj Pasek and Justin Paul becoming EGOTs in September 2024, and **Source [15]** indicates Elton John joined the EGOT club in January 2024. Given this, and knowing the list of EGOT winners is not exhaustively provided in any single source up to my knowledge cutoff, we infer the sequence based on available data:\n\n- If Elton John is mentioned as a newer inductee in **[15]**, and Benj Pasek and Justin Paul achieved EGOT status later in 2024 (**[4]**), and considering the other mentioned winners, we deduce the list's sequence up to the point of available information.\n\n**Direct Answer Based on Available Information:**\n\nGiven the constraints and focusing on the direct question without speculation beyond provided sources:\n\n- **The sources do not explicitly mention who the tenth EGOT winner is in a straightforward, sequential list that includes all winners up to the tenth.**\n\nHowever, combining all insights and the fact that **Source [4]** mentions the 2024 additions to the EGOT list, and considering the sequential nature of EGOT achievements:\n\n- **If we were to infer based on the pattern of announcements and the timing provided in Sources [4] and [15], without a clear, direct statement on the tenth winner, the precise answer to who is the tenth EGOT winner cannot be definitively concluded from the given sources.**\n\n**Recommendation for Further Information:**\n\nFor the most accurate and up-to-date information, consulting the latest updates from reputable sources such as Billboard, Britannica, or official award websites (Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, Tony) would be advisable.\n\n**Source Citations for This Response:**\n[1], [2], [4], [14], [15], [18], [19]","enhanced_queries":["tenth EGOT winner","list of EGOT winners in chronological order site:wikipedia.org","\"latest EGOT recipients\" (Emmy & Grammy & Oscar & Tony Awards) after 2020"],"metadata":{"topic":"Other","answer_type":"Person","urls":["https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_EGOT_winners","https:\/\/www.goldderby.com\/gallery\/egot-emmy-grammy-oscar-tony\/richard-rodgers-70th-birthday-party-new-york-26-mar-1972\/","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_EGOT_winners#EGOT_winners","https:\/\/www.cbr.com\/egot-winner-chronological-order\/"]},"retrieved_urls":["https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/topic\/list-of-EGOT-winners-2230527","https:\/\/www.buzzfeed.com\/jake_farrington\/every-egot-winner","https:\/\/www.billboard.com\/lists\/egot-winners-complete-list-analysis","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/EGOT","https:\/\/simple.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_EGOT_winners"],"search_results":{},"success":true,"error":null,"final_grade":"C"}

However, based on the information available, here are some relevant findings:\n\n* Gaspar Corte-Real led two voyages to North America, sponsored by the Portuguese Crown, around the turn of the 16th century [1, 2, 10].\n* In 1500, he reached a cold, snow-covered land in the northwestern Atlantic, believed to be Greenland [10, 13].\n* On his second voyage in 1501, he landed in a country with large rivers, pine trees, and berries, thought to be Labrador, where he captured 57 indigenous people [10, 15].\n* There is no explicit mention of Gaspar Corte-Real visiting or discovering the specific town of Portugal Cove-St. Philip's in any of the provided sources.\n\n**Inference:** Given the lack of direct information about Gaspar Corte-Real's connection to Portugal Cove-St. Philip's, it is uncertain whether he ever reached this particular town.

However, the year is not specified in these sources.\n* Source [7] provides a comment from a user named \"beansauce\" on 2024\/11\/19, mentioning that \"Slip'kik is the hardcore server.\" This implies that the Hardcore server was already known to exist or be upcoming as of November 19, 2024.\n* Considering the context and the fact that Source [2] and [3] are dated (as indicated by the \"2y ago\" comment, suggesting a post from 2023), it's reasonable to infer that the August 24 release might not align with the 2024 context provided by other sources.\n* Since the majority of the sources, especially those with higher relevance (e.g., [1], [4], [7]), discuss the 20th Anniversary Edition and its features around late 2024, and given the lack of a specific year in Sources [2] and [3], we might assume these sources are less relevant for pinpointing the exact date within the 2024-2025 timeframe.\n\nHowever, **the most direct and clear information regarding the release of WoW Classic Hardcore servers in the context of late 2024 or early 2025 isn't explicitly provided in the sources with high relevance and clarity on the topic of release dates for 2024 or 2025**.\n\nGiven the information available and focusing on the question's request for the day, month, and year of the earliest release of WoW Classic Hardcore official servers, **we cannot accurately determine the year (whether it's within 2024 or if the August date applies to a different year) based on the provided sources with sufficient confidence**.
